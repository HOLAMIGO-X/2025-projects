# BMR Calculator

This Python program calculates your **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** and **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)** using the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation**. It estimates the number of calories you burn at rest and adjusts for activity level to give an accurate daily calorie estimate.

## Features
- **BMR Calculation**: Calculates BMR based on weight, height, age, and gender.
- **TDEE Estimation**: Calculates TDEE based on activity level (Sedentary to Very Active).
