# BMI Calculation Program with Customer Inquiry

This is a **Python** program that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on user input and provides a categorization of the BMI (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obesity). Additionally, the program collects **customer details** like age, weight, height, and optional contact information to create a more personalized report.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation**: Calculates BMI using the formula:
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}
  \]
  
- **BMI Categorization**: Categorizes the BMI into:
  - **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5
  - **Normal weight**: 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
  - **Overweight**: 25 <= BMI < 29.9
  - **Obesity**: BMI >= 30

- **Customer Inquiry**: Collects **age**, **weight**, **height**, and **optional contact information** to personalize the BMI report.

- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid user input for weight and height.

## Requirements

This program is written in Python and doesn't require any external libraries. It works with basic Python functionality.
